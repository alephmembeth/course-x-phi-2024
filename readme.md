# Forschungsorientierte Einführung in die Experimentelle Philosophie

This is a repository for the course “Forschungsorientierte Einführung in die Experimentelle Philosophie” (research-oriented introduction to experimental philosophy), organized by Stephan Kornmesser and me in the summer term of 2024 at the University of Oldenburg.

- Course slides are available in `/slides`.
- Materials, data, and results of a replication of Knobe’s “Intentional Action and Side Effects in Ordinary Language”[^1] are available in `/replication knobe`.
- Materials, data, and results of three student projects are available in `/civil disobedience`, `/autonomous systems`, and `/moral obligation`.

There’s a [blog entry](https://xphi.net/2024/04/29/teaching-experimental-philosophy-to-beginners-part-1/) about the replication on [The Experimental Philosophy Blog](https://xphi.net/).
